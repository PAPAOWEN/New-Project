# New-Project
# Big Picture 
In this project I will be looking forward to develope a program that can be used to calculate complex equations with one(or two?) variable.The calculators that we normally use in school are usually limited in terms of their ability to calculate the eaquations with variable in them.Even if for one who is familar with these calculators, it takes a lot of work to figure out how to solve a equation on the calculator.So I want to create this program that can essentially reduce the complexity of this process that the user only needs to put in the constants presented and the result would just come out automatically.
Eventually I want this program to be able to solve calculus1 equations at least.

# First Step
And for the first round I'm looking to create one that can solve quadratic equations, which is a pretty difficult to do on calculators.

# TEST PLAN
In order for the users to check if this program is working they can type in the constants for the equation and compare the results of my program to that of the actually value that a calculator would've given(though it'd waaaaaay slower than the program.)For example the user can type in 3x^2+4x-1=4, and solve this on their calculator. By comparing the results, it would prove my program works.Just in case on any coincidence, the user should try at least 3 different equations in order to get a wider range of evidence so they won't be using the wrong values.
