# New-Project
# Big Picture 
In this project I will be looking forward to develope a program that can be used to calculate complex equations with one(or two?) variable.The calculators that we normally use in school are usually limited in terms of their ability to calculate the eaquations with variable in them.Even if for one who is familar with these calculators, it takes a lot of work to figure out how to solve a equation on the calculator.So I want to create this program that can essentially reduce the complexity of this process that the user only needs to put in the constants presented and the result would just come out automatically.
Eventually I want this program to be able to solve calculus1 equations at least.

# First Step
For the first round I am looking forward to create a program that can determine the number of solutions that one quadratic equation has. Which is a classic problem in Trig that takes rather a long time to finish.

# TEST PLAN
In order to check if my program is working, the users can type in equations that they already know the number of solutions and to check if the result from my program. I suggest testing the program at least with three different equations.

# Reflection and Revision
For this round of the project I am still just counting the amount of sotions that these equations have. It is not yet very close to a real calculator. I think in order for me to finish this project, I need to learn more about the mathematic functions in python in order to complete this program. 
# Next Steps
My next step of this project would still be on quadratic formular. However, instead of just counting the amount of solutions that one has. I will be looking to find the actual result for more practical uses.
